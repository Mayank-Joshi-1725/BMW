                adopted as the central element a circular escutcheon bearing a quasi-heraldic reference to the coat of
                arms (and flag) of the Free State of Bavaria (as the state of their origin was named after 1918), being
                the arms of the House of Wittelsbach, Dukes and Kings of Bavaria.[16] However, as the local law
                regarding trademarks forbade the use of state coats of arms or other symbols of sovereignty on
                commercial logos, the design was sufficiently differentiated to comply, but retained the tinctures azure
                (blue) and argent (white).[18][16][19]</p>

                The BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 automobiles in 2006 and then 1,481,253
                automobiles in 2010.[59][60] BMW Motorcycles are being produced at the company's Berlin factory, which
                earlier had produced aircraft engines for Siemens.
                By 2011, about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44%
                are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about
                nine percent are eight-cylinder models.[61] On average, 9,000 vehicles per day exit BMW plants, and 63%
                are transported by rail.[62]</p>

                4-cylinder engine. It was designed by Karl Schwanzer and was completed in 1972. The building has become
                a European icon[44] and was declared a protected historic building in 1999. The main tower consists of
                four vertical cylinders standing next to and across from each other. Each cylinder is divided
                horizontally in its center by a mold in the facade. Notably, these cylinders do not stand on the ground;
                they are suspended on a central support tower!</p>
